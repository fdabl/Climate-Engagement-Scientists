    - `main_analyses.Rmd` runs the analyses reported in the main text of the paper (except creating Figure 1).
    - `representativity_analysis.Rmd` runs the sample representativity analysis.
    - `world_map.R` creates a world map showing observations across countries.
    - `figure1.R` creates Figure 1.
- `data/`
    - `DataS1_Anonymized.RDS` is the raw anonymized data.
    - `DataS2_Imputed.RDS` is the imputed data.
    - `DataS3_Final.RDS` is the final data set used for quantitative analysis.
    - `DataS4_Qualitative.RDS` is the data set used for qualitative analysis.
    - `Codebook_DataS4_Qualitative.xlx` is the codebook for the qualitative data.
